# Excel to Azure Table Storage.
This is a console application to convert Microsoft Excel data to AzureTableStorage. Azure Table is a very exciting one and Excel worksheets suits them the most. But unfortunately a converter, that converts any existing Excel file to Azure Table is not detected (there might be, but my google didn't show that to me).

## How to
* Very simple, download the release from [here](https://github.com/IshamMohamed/excel-to-azure-table-storage/releases) and make it inside a folder. 
* Copy the Excel file you want to convert in the same folder
* Remember the worksheet number you need to convert
* Open cmd.exe, execute `ExcelToAzureTable.exe [excel_file_name] [worksheet_number]`
* eg : `ExcelToAzureTable.exe sample.xlsx 1`
